# find the next highest number with the same digits
# [1,2,3,4]
# [1,2,4,3]
# [1,3,4,2]
# [1,4,3,2]
# [1,4,3,2]

# iterate from tail, find first decreasing element
# PROOF: if its all increasing, there is nothing we can do to make the next number smaller
# iterate from taila gain, find first element bigger than this thing
# PROOF: if we swap with any other element, the resulting number will be bigger
