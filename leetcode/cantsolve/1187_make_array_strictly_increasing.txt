F[i][j] : min num of replacements if we replace s[i] with t[j]
G[i] : min number of replacement if we do not replace s[i]

F[i][j] is minimum of:
	F[i-1][j-1] + 1 If j > 0: if we replaced the last one, we can replace this one because t[j] is in sorted order
	G[i-1] + 1 if t[j] > s[i-1]: if we don't replace the last one and we can replace this one, do it

G[i] is the minimum of:
	G[i-1] if s[i] > s[i-1] : we have no need to replace the last one
	F[i-1][j] if t[j] < s[i]: we can replace the previous one s[i-1] with this t[j]
